  <p align="justify">The silent whispers of the empty station settled in the void that was my heart. I always craved a moment of peace ever since I moved to the metropolis but now, when it finally arrived, I felt as I had been engulfed in a cloud of
    loneliness. And
    as the last train carried me to my two-room apartment, I realised that moving was the easy part.</p>
  <p align="justify">As I entered my new home, I was greeted by taped cardboard boxes, waiting to be unpacked, a faint smell of fresh paint (at least the landlord whitewashed the house before I moved), dusty furniture, crumpled newspapers, and… no
    smiles. Moving to
    a new city alone, seemed exciting but coming home to a mess isn’t what I imagined it to be. Unfortunately, the morning I moved was also the first of my new job and I couldn’t get a lot of time to settle in.
    The daylit hours were filled with constant screaming of cars, screeching breaks, and quarrels of people. My colleagues seemed nice but distant and despite learning the lingo of this strange noisy land, I just couldn’t fit in. I finally understood
    why they say that people living in big cities have small hearts.
  </p>
  <p align="justify">Throughout the day, my mind drifted towards the memories I had of my old life. There was strange tranquillity even in the nosiest of bazaars. The stern expressions around me reminded me of the lovely grins of the townspeople. The
    laughs I shared
    with my friends back home seemed so far away and I swore that I’d do anything to laugh my heart out again. Clinging to memories of the past, I somehow managed to sail through the day. But, even in the quiet of the night, my mind was anxious and
    desperately sought solace.</p>
  <p align="justify">I examined the unpacked boxes again and carefully slit one open using a blunt kitchen knife. The crackle of the old cassette player welcomed me with open arms as it played my favourite melodies. The cassette player belonged to my
    dad when he was
    young. He insisted I take it with me when I moved here. I guess he knew that I would need a comforting companion for long lonely nights.</p>
  <p align="justify">The silence of my house was replaced with old songs that I used to listen to as a kid. I remember fighting over which song would be played next on warm summer evenings with my brother. I finally started unpacking everything else
    and arranging my
    belongings on the empty shelves. Occasionally, I dusted the furniture, humming away the somewhat lost tunes of the past.
    It took me quite a while to get everything done. It was past 3 AM and the music had finally stopped. Again, I found myself alone with my thoughts. I imagined the day ahead of me. The cold stares, the loud roads, and the crowded trains. I never
    knew that being constantly surrounded by thousands if not millions of people would ever make me feel so alone. The dreadful thoughts of being alone in an entirely new place suddenly hit me like a bus. After what felt like an eternity, a growl in
    my stomach made me snap out of it. I forgot to have dinner. If mum ever found out that I “forgot” to have dinner she’d personally come here to scold me. I let out a sad chuckle. I wish I could tell her. I wish she was here.
  </p>
  <p align="justify">I made my way to the kitchen and opened the fridge. It was empty. Of course, I knew that, but maybe I was looking for every opportunity to remind myself that I was in fact, all alone. Tired and sleep-deprived, I munched some
    biscuits that I
    bought from a local vendor back in my hometown. The biscuits were homemade and I’d always have them while coming back from school with my friends. The shopkeeper knew us and would sometimes even scold us for snacking all the time. I missed that
    too.</p>
